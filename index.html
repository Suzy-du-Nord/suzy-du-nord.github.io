                <h2>Ryan Iem</h2>
                <h3>Working Holiday Maker in Japan</h3>
                <p>I pride myself on being a reliable, hard-working and focused person who 
                    loves learning about new technologies and loves interacting with new 
                    people. My key interests include Cloud Computing, Networking and 
                    Programming (Web and Python).</p>
                <p>Currently, I am spending a year in Japan to improve my Japanese, immerse 
                    myself in the culture, and experience a completely different working culture. 
                    During my time in Japan, I have been freelance English teaching as well as 
                    working in the hospitality industry in various locations throughout Japan.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I'm very interested in Japanese literature, music, 
                    coffee and cats üê±
